# animals

This repository contains a collection of API descriptions for a hypothetical
division of an enterprise that uses API Hub. This "animals" division has a
number of synthetically generated APIs associated with animals in various
stages of their life cycles. All of these APIs will be proxied in a single
Apigee X organization and tracked in an API Hub instance alongside APIs from at
least one other hypothetical division.
